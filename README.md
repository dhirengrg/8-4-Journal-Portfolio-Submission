1.	How do I approach designing software?
   
To approach the software design process, I would begin with understanding the project and the possible problems. For the future work I would focus on the needs and preferences, research, and analysis, use the idea and concepts, and testing, and implementation.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

To approach the developing program, need the analyzing, design, coding, testing etc. The new strategies that are used while working on the 3D scene were to break down the problems into small segments and analyze the function closely.  The testing and coding at the same time throughout the milestone led me to complete the project on time so that I can analyze and implement the idea into it to make it work.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science helped me to reach my goal by enabling me to problem solving, critical thinking, creativity etc. My future educational pathway the computational graphics and visualization, would be helpful to implement the knowledge of designing and skills of code.
